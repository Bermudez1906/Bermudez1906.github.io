        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am a computer science major with a minor in cybersecurity, driven by a deep curiosity for how technology works and how it can be made better, smarter, and safer. From writing code to learning how to defend systems against modern threats, I’m passionate about both building and protecting the digital tools we rely on every day. As I continue exploring where I thrive, whether that’s in software development, cybersecurity, or somewhere in between, I’m focused on growing my skills, solving real-world problems, and staying adaptable. My goal is to contribute to meaningful projects that make technology more powerful, more secure, and more accessible to everyone.
